We use this tool to monitor file changes on disk, so we can analyze out the
minimum system for MI base.

1. Compile:
  g++ fnotify.cpp -o fnotify

2. put fnotify to MI base system path: usr/bin/fnotify

3. copy fnotify.service to usr/lib/systemd/system/fnotify.service
4. modify the service file to adjust the start order.
   e.g. add Requires=fnotify.service in file:
   ./bootscripts.mgc30_64/etc/systemd/system/default.target

fnotify exe program accept a directories list, and it will monitor these
directories recursively. the file changes action will be logged into log file
/var/log/fnotify.log

It is a deamon now, we will do lot of adjust work on this tool.
